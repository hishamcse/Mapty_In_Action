# Mapty_In_Action
 
A simple mapty app using Leafletjs library based on this demo [project](https://mapty.netlify.app/) <br />
I have reimplemented and extended that version adding some extra features. Will add more features soon insha'allah <br />
Currently Implemented Features:
  1. Loading map based on user's current location
  2. adding workout
  3. Adding marker on map at specific location
  4. edit a workout
  5. delete a workout
  6. delete all workouts
  7. sorting workouts based on two fields
  8. Storing data in browser (local storage)
